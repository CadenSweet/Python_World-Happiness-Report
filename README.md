# Python_World-Happiness-Report
For this assignment, I was tasked with finding an open-sourced data set. 
The one I decided to use was from the World Happiness Report, which is a survey that ranks participating countries based off of their overall happiness.

## Index

1. Project Brief 
3. Scripts (containing code used to perform analyses) 
4. Analysis (containing visualizations) 
5. Sent to client (document containing a link to Tableau visualization)

## Objective

Since this was the final project for my program, I was to use all the skills I have developed to analyze and wrangle the data. 
Then, using Tableau, I created a storyboard to present my findings.

## Data

The World Happiness Report data set came from their [website](https://worldhappiness.report/)
